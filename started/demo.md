title: Run Fyne Demo

---

If you want to see the Fyne toolkit in action before you start to code your own application,
you can see our [demo app](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/tree/master/cmd/fyne_demo) application.

Recent updates to the Go tools mean that you need to install the application to test it.

### Build

If you want to, you can also install the demo using the following command (requires Go 1.16 or later):

    $ go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest

For earlier versions of Go, you need to use the following command instead:

    $ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo


###Â Running

If your `GOBIN` environment has been added to path (should be by default on macOS and Windows), you can then run the demo:

    $ fyne_demo

By browsing the different tabs of the app you can see all the features of Fyne toolkit.

### Installing

It is possible to install the app as a graphical application like all others on your computer.
We have the helpful `fyne` tool to do this for you.
First you will need to install the tool:

	go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest

After that you can simply package and install the demo app:

	fyne get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo

After this step you can find "Fyne Demo" in your app launcher.
