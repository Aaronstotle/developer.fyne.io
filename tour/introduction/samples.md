title: Building Code Samples
order: 3

---

The code samples in this tutorial can be built and run on your computer,
all you need is a working [Go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).

Once you have Go installed you can copy any example
(use the "Copy Code" button) and paste it into a text file.
Save the file with ".go" extension, such as "hello.go".
You can then run the file directly using "go run" on the command line:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

This command will run the application from your computer. For simple go
programs this will output some information to your command line. However
most examples in this tour will open a new window on your computer!

They can also be built as applications to run later using the
"go build" command;

```bash
go build hello.go
```

This will create an executable file that can be run any number of times.
