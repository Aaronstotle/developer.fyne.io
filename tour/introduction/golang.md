Fyne is built using the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language.
We chose this as it's an easy to learn language that can build applications
for many different operating systems.

All applications built using Fyne also use Go - if it is not
familiar to you, we recommend following the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/).

As defined on their website :\\
"Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software."

It is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#STATIC),
[compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language)
[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
designed at Google.
