The box widget is a simple horizontal or vertical container
that uses the [box layout](../layout/boxlayout.md) to lay out
the child components. You can pass the objects to include in
the `container.NewHBox()` or `container.NewVBox()` constructor functions.

It is also possible to add items to a box widget after it is
created using `Add()` (to after the existing content)
or remove items using `Remove()`.
