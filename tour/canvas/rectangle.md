`canvas.Rectangle` is the simplest canvas object in Fyne. It displays
a block of the specified colour. You can also set the colour using
the `FillColor` field.

In this example the rectangle fills the window as it is
the only content element.

Other `fyne.CanvaObject` types have more configuration, let us look
[next](text) at `canvas.Text`.
