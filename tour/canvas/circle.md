`canvas.Circle` defines a circle shape filled by the specified
colour. You may also set a `StrokeWidth` and therefore a different
`StrokeColor` as shown in this example.

The circle will fill the space specified by calling `Resize()` or
by the layout it is controlled by. As the example sets the circle
as the window content it will resize to fill the window, within a
basic padding (controlled by the theme).

All these have been basic types that can be rendered by our driver
with no additional information. Next we will look at more complex types
starting with [`Image`](image).
